0: [BOS] The King must leave the throne now. [EOS] But not now! Nay, yet, there will be a king
whose blood is mine, and whose blood is mine.

PRINCE ELIZABETH:
I cannot bear it.

BOS:
What of us?

ESCALUS:
Our gods!

BOS:
We live in their blood, and our gods are ours.

ESCALUS:
We love them, and we love them with the blood we give them
from our blood, as well as that of the gods.

BOS:
O thou art not the king, and thou art not my slave: thy
blood and my own will are mine, if thou
use them.

ESCALUS:
A prophet! and he that speaks that is not
my servant is my brother; for I am
my brother; but he that speaks that is my brother,
and he that speaks that is not mine shall live; my
slave shall live the rest of their lives; but my
slave shall live those that speak not my name and
my slave shall live their lives.

BOS:
Thou hast not lived this year, and I cannot live:
what I did do, I do not know. But thou know
how many times thou dost die.

ESCALUS
